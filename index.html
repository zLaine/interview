<h2>Interview</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players through an interview, after choosing stats for themselves to have focused on during their education.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will be prompted to think about their own strengths and weaknesses and get to tinker around with interviewing.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A text-based "choose your own adventure"-esque story involving stats.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player uses to mouse to click and choose what they want to spend their skill points on, then navigate choices in the interview.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Experimentation with making a game so relient on text enjoyable, as well as figuring out button use and better text handling.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The specific context is what makes this game unique -- an interview specific to game programmers.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
It's about a person getting out of school and interviewing.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who would like to get a job programming games, or enjoy text-based games.  
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As it currently stands, this should probably take only a few minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Effective strategies in the current version involve insuring that you're versatile -- having no skills in any particular area can really hurt your chances of getting a job!
